# SC4SNMP (Splunk Connect for SNMP) Dashboard

This folder contains a dashboard (WIP) to get insights out of [SC4SNMP](https://splunk.github.io/splunk-connect-for-snmp/main) metrics. This dashboard was built for `snmpd` running on Linux. Metric names may be different for other devices, which would require the dashboard to be updated.

## Setup

This dashboard requires [SC4SNMP](https://splunk.github.io/splunk-connect-for-snmp/main) to be set up:

- [SC4SNMP official documentation](https://splunk.github.io/splunk-connect-for-snmp/main)
- [Walkthrough of SC4SNMP setup with Linux agents running `snpmd`](https://smathur-splunk.github.io/workshops/snmp_intro)
